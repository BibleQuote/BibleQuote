SimpleTimer, ver. 2.0.3


- ver. 2.0.3: Added property Tag to make SimpleTimer compatible with TTimer.

- ver. 2.0.2: No functional change, just a correction of the demo and 
  the documentation (Create was used instead of CreateEx).

- ver. 2.0.1: Since overloaded methods are not allowed in D2 and D3
  I renamed the second constructor from "Create" to "CreateEx" and
  dropped the overload directive.

- ver. 2.0.0: Major restructuring. Big thanks go to mikk from Hungary
  for contributing with suggestions and code. Changes in 2.0.0 include:
  * The Start and Stop methods have been replaced with Enabled and Interval
    properties, so SimpleTimer resembles TTimer more closely.
  * The callback method is replaced by an OnTimer event.
  * Added AutoDisable and CallBackMethod properties.
  * Added two stand-alone methods.
  +++++ See convert_st_projects.txt if you are using SimpleTimer already +++++

- ver. 1.0.3: Reintroduced reference to the Forms unit, as it was needed
  by Delphi 5 and below (doh!).

- ver. 1.0.2: Removed reference to the Forms unit.

- ver. 1.0.1: Removed exception handling from the WndProc method as it
  would catch any and all exceptions, including the ones which were
  supposed to be thrown. Thanks to George Mealer for telling me.

- ver. 1.0.0: First release.



If you have any comments or corrections, I would very much like to 
hear them.
