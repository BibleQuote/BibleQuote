The following demos are distributed with CoolTrayIcon 4.0.0:

                 (this is necessary if you need more than 128 chars. in the tooltip)


CustomHint1 was more or less a port of a VB project by Eduardo A. Morcillo 
(http://www.domaindlx.com/e_morcillo).
CustomHint2 was made by Zeljko Avramovic and modified by me.
All other demos were made by me.

If you have a cool demo demonstrating how to accomplish a task with CoolTrayIcon
or TextTrayIcon, send it to me.
