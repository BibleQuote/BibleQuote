                        - first steps towards support utf16 (by Kevin Zhang)
                        - implemented another locate routine (by jbannon)
                        - changed treatment of datatype text. It is considered 'longtext' now.
                          added 'shorttext' datatype which replaces the original 'text' datatype.
                          The datatype text is now compatible with sqlite3, mysql and perhaps
                          others.

                        - implementation of unidirectional dataset. This improves
                          performance on large resultsets to the optimum. However
                          the dataset is readonly by default, using inserts/deletes and
                          updates will result in a 'database table is locked' error.

                        - Compatibility fixes for D45 (Art Register)
                        - changed D45 directive to $IFDEF ASQLITE_D6PLUS so
                          compilation should work automatically now

                          Date type is stored yyyy-mm-dd, Time type is stored hh:nn:ss.mmm
                          It's possible that next release will only use hh:nn:ss due
                          to problems with vcl components who do not support mmm.

              sept 14,2006 Release OldStyle 2006.09.B
                        - OK, Within the null support release it appeared that it
                          had a lot of obscure problems. This was costing me so much time
                          I decided to recover and implement another null support based
                          on the latest stable release (by Jure) and patched all the
                          updates from the forum. I also implemented the following patches:
                        - Kevin Lu: patch for utf8

                        - Added InTransactionFunction
                        - Fixes for collation (Jure)
                        - Fixes for Null Support (Jure) to solve DUnit isues
                          (by Sean)
                        - Null support for Blobs is not supported. Due to the
                          fact that a null value is kept with the field, the
                          Blob object is always created thus causing the field
                          to contain the blobpointer which is never null...
                          Try to fix that in some other version. There where some
                          code changes necessary to let the DUnit tests run through.
                        - Other (minor) isues.
              mar 6, 2007 Release 2007.03.A
                        - Unicode support. Currently nBlob is implemented as
                          WideString due to some isues with tntMemo.
                          (thanks Sasa for testing (szutils.com))

                          used any-more. This means that the datatype
