TextTrayIcon, ver. 1.2.1


- ver. 1.2.1: Bugfix: The background icon was not freed when TextTrayIcon
  was destroyed.

- ver. 1.2.0: A big thanks to Jouni Airaksinen, who suggested
  improvements to the drawing/painting methods. The background
  icon should now display with the correct colors.

- ver. 1.1.1: Some internal class-level handling is introduced as a
  result of updating the parent component CoolTrayIcon. Updated the
  documentation.

- ver. 1.1.0: A background icon is introduced. Property ShowTextIcon
  is discarded.

- ver. 1.0.0: First release. TextTrayIcon is distributed together 
  with the CoolTrayIcon component (ver. 3.0.0). Some of the code 
  was inspired by an example Robert Price sent me.



If you have any comments or corrections, I would very much like to 
hear them.
