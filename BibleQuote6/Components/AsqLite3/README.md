# ASQLite3

This is the **Delphi SQLite** set of DAC components from [aducom software](http://www.aducom.com/), based on their latest release for Delphi 2009, and updated to support newer editions of Delphi as included in [RemObjects Data Abstract for Delphi](http://www.remobjects.com/da).

Like the original version (not available on GitHub, or we would have forked it from there), this version is released and distributed under the [FreeBSD License](http://www.freebsd.org/copyright/freebsd-license.html).
