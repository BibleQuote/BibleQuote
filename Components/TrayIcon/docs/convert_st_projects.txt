Version 2.0.0 of SimpleTimer is incompatible with older versions, which
means you will have to adjust your previous projects that use SimpleTimer.


1) The Start and Stop methods have been replaced with the Enabled and Interval
properties, to make SimpleTimer more interchangeable with TTimer.

To start the timer you will need to first set the Interval, then set Enabled 
to True (just like TTimer). Also, you must specify an OnTimer event method 
(see below).


2) The callback method you used for receiving notifications from a SimpleTimer
object has been replaced by an OnTimer event. This both makes SimpleTimer
easier to use and makes it look more like TTimer.
